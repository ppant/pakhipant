Hello Guest,	
Welcome! My name is Pakhi, I am 9 years old, class IV student. My hobbies are building Lego, cycling, cricket. I love to play outside. I am learning how to write computer programs from my father. I love to spend time with scratch, I like scratch because, I can play games, and the best part is that is all games are made of Programming and in scratch we can make games.

Thanks for visiting.
