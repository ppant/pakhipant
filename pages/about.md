Hello Guest, Welcome! 

My name is Pakhi, I am 9 years old, class IV student. My hobbies are building Lego, Making Craft, Cycling and Cricket. I love to play outdoors.

I am learning to write computer programs from [my father](https://pradeeppant.com/). I love to spend time on scratch. I like scratch because I can play games. The best part in scratch is that all the games are made of Programming. In scratch we can make the games as well .

I will take you through my learning ride.
