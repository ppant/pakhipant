Hi
This is my first post. I am exploring scrath and made a small fun game using  code blocks. 

This is a Popping game, when we touch the ballons then it automatically changes its position and the color. I have used the Video Sensing code block to get the video and motion.

First Click on the start button (Green flag) then click on any ballon, after that use hands to play with video camera.

Hope you will enjoy this fun game.

And happy playing.
