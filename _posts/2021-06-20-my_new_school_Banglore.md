Hi,friends
Do you know that,I shifted from Delhi to Banglore.
So, I needed to pack my own clothes and, I helped my mother and father and my grandparents in packing their clothes and, I needed to pack my toys and more it was a fun flight, I ate good food do know, I didn't sleep, I was awake all the time. I was in the flight at 8:00am and we landed at 01:00 PM. 

The weather in Balgalore is very good. I am very excited about my new school but due to corona I am taking classes from home.And in the classes,I made a lot of friends. 


Thank you!
