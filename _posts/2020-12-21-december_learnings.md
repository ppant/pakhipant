Hi,
This month I have learned how to make a mini shelf using cardborad and a thread releasing tool.

![](/pakhipant/data/images/thread_releasing_tool.jpg){:width="800px"}

So, this device is a thread releasing device. It's easy to pull thread from the device as the edge of the thread does not get lost. The pins in the corners keeps the reel in its place. I have installed the tool in mini side shelf which I have made using cardboard. 

I have used the following things:

* Small cardboard
* Double sided tape
* Ice cream stick
* 6  paper clips
* Thread roll
* Color wrap for decoration 
  

Thank you!
