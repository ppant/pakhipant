Hi,


![](/data/images/earth-revolution.jpg){:width="800px"}

This month, I about how earth rotates around its own axis (rotation) and how earth moves around the Sun(revolution)

Earth completes one rotation in 24 hours changing day and night.

One revolution of earth around the Sun takes 365 days changing months and seasons. 

I leant this by using [flintobox](https://flintobox.com/).
 

Thank you!
